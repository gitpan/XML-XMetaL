    - First CPAN release version. Still in alpha state.
    
0.51 
    - gmcr.pl now generates On_Macro_File_Load() call
      without trying to pass the active document as an argument.
      This is necessary because when the macro is called, the
      active document has not yet been opened.
      
    - XML::XMetaL::Base AUTOLOAD method used to generate
      default handlers that opened a dialog box when called.
      The dialog has been replaced with a status text message.
      This ensures that default events can be called without
      blocking normal XMetaL operation.
